			<h2><a href="#about">About Us</a></h2>
		
		
			<p>The Mac Group is an Ottawa area Apple Authorized Sales and Service shop. We’ve been in business since 1991, and in Ottawa since 1995. What we do best is provide high quality service; one on one, helping you reach the best decision with your new or used Mac, choosing the best service option for your ailing Mac, helping you figure out Digital Lifestyle Solutions, such as setting up a Mac music server, or helping you choose from brands such as Martin Logan, Magnepan, Nuforce and Jolida, to build a high end music system. Because we love music as much as we love our Macs. Coming soon, devices that connect to your wifi network and open your front door, provide video security, or change lighting, among many other things. It’s a Wifi world out there, and robots will be bringing you your beer and wine in no time. So get ready. We are.</p>

			<p>Apple: Generally, Apple prices are the same everywhere. We offer a small discount, $20 here, $30 there, on products we have a tiny bit of room to move on, but certainly not iPads or Mac Mini’s, for example. Still, we beat Apple’s listed price on most products, if only by a bit. Unless you have a trade in. Then we have a bit more room, so please ask us.

Apple Third Party: We sell a wide variety of third party Apple products; Ac adaptors, Cables, Hard Drives, Ram, Mice, Keyboards, Etc.

* We list the Coming Soon items because roughly 30% of our used/trade-in products sell before they’re prepped for on-the-shelf sale. If you see something that interests you here; drop us a line and we’ll notify you when we have it instore, before we refurb it and generally before it gets on this page. And if you don’t see what you’re looking for, drop us a note and ask to go on our wait list for that product.</p>

			<h2><a href="#audio">Audio</a></h2>
			
			<p>What? High end audio in a Mac Store? Of course; it’s time has come. We’ve been on the leading edge of the adoption of digital servers for years now, and finally the market is now mainstream. Besides, We love great sounding audio products! Our focus is on good quality sound, but value is also a very big deal for us. And value and High end audio are sometimes roads that never intersect. But we’ve made it our focus. We won’t ever, ever be selling $2000 power cables, or $75,000 CD Players. There’s other shops for that if you’re so inclined. We aim to be a different sort of reseller, as our demo fees (more about that later) clearly illustrate.</p>
	
			<p>We are Authorized Resellers for  MartinLogan, Magnepan, Peachtree Audio, Jolida, Rogue Audio, Nuforce, Grado, and others.</p>
			
			<p>We’re still trying to create space at our new Downtown location to demo Audio, and we’re getting there; we should have limited demo space for Peachtree, Magnepan, and Focal soon, and will update here when it’s available.</p>
			
								<p>The Controversial Demo Fee Policy!</p>
	
			<p>Here’s an explanation of our somewhat controversial Demo fees. We charge you for a 20 minute demo of any of our audio products. The fee is kept as a store credit for you if you choose to buy the product, or any high end audio product, from us, ever. We’ve decided this is the only way we can resell high end audio; our business keeps us very busy, and we just don’t have the time to offer demos to anyone who walks in the door. We just aren’t that kind of shop. After 7 years of retailing these products, we found that our demo to resale ratio was crazy, it was unsustainable. Probably because everyone wants to hear Maggies and Ottawa hasn’t had a dealer in many many years. The question was, discontinue offering these products, or find something workable for us. We think this is workable, and will also allow us to demo more gear as well. We do realize this will alienate some customers, but the policy is in place so that we can continue offering these products. Better to serve customers who understand why this is necessary than not serve any customers at all and lose what’s been a decent product line for us. Here’s the fee structure:</p>
			
			<p>20 Minute Demo, Under $1000-----2%</p>
			<p>20 Minute Demo, Over $1000-----1%</p>
			
			<p>We’re obviously not going to retire on these fees. But they should do what we put them in place to do. And if you’re a tried and true customer, don’t worry,we won’t be charging you any fees. </p>

			<h2><a href="#services">Services</a></h2>
			
			<p>Apple Service downtown? Why wait for a reservation, pay for parking, lug your computer to the store in the mall, wait to be served, then do it all again when your computer is finally fixed? Why not just drive 3 minutes down the street, park in our free lot, get served right away, and get it back faster?</p>
			
			<p>We are Apple Authorized Service Providers, and provide warranty repair for Apple Computers, Apple TV, iPad, and peripherals.</p>
			
			<p>We also perform out of warranty work; our rates are $90 per hour (most work takes about an hour or less), Diagnostics, $45, and onsite repair, $110 per hour plus $25 Travel fee inside the Ottawa area. We are able to repair water-damaged or large issue (LogicBoard, Screen) problems with access to used and 3rd party components at more reasonable cost than Apple Store. </p>
			
			<p>Hannes Botha runs service, and is one of the most experienced Apple technicians in the Ottawa area.</p>

		<section id="tradein">
		
			<h2><a href="#tradein">Trade In/Sell Your Mac</a></h2>
			<p>We love trade-ins, used Apple products hold up well and offer good value in the resale market. They also get you closer to your new Mac than you might think. Because our demand for used Macs is strong, we’re able to offer much better pricing than the 50% of retail value (as determined by Ebay’s Terapeak) that is the typical trade in offer. We are able to pay 70 to 85% of retail, because we do a strong volume in used Macs. Which is to say, we make it up with volume. </p>
	
	<p>If you aren’t quite ready to get a new Mac, or you’re (shudder) considering going over to another platform, we do buy Apple products for cash money. Let’s face it, not everyone wants to wade through the low ball offers or crazy people emails Kijiji ads can generate. And you don’t have to. Our offers are very close if not better than what you may get selling privately, the process is fast and simple, and wham, you have a cheque in hand. Again, we use mactosell.net to establish retail value, and pay between 70 to 85% of that value for working condition and in good shape products. If a product is older than five years or so, or it’s a low demand product, or, for whatever reason, we feel it will take longer for us to resell it, we may offer less.</p>

		<section id="rentals">
			
			<h2><a href="#rentals">Rentals</a></h2>
			
			<p>We rent out used Macs we have in stock, or demo models, so our pricing is much better than the rental companies who specialize in this area.</p>
	
			<p>Example: iMac 27; 2-3 years old, $129 weekly, $349 monthly</p>
			
			<p>Our rental machines vary, so drop us a line, Facebook us on our  FB page, or call for availability.</p>
